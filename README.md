This small project uses JavaScript to render infinite lists of multiple levels. The lists have nested lists that are also rendered. The sub-lists can be nested to any level and it will be displayed. Each sub-list can be closed to not render  on the screen, making it easier to skim through the list. 

----------IMPORTANT----------

This isn't the best practice as the DOM is being targeted directly. I couldn't find a good tutorial that can so it via states.
